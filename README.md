# Android Leaderboard Project
This Android project aims to create a leaderboard with sticky scrolling functionality and enhanced security using ProGuard. Below are the key features and changes implemented in this project.

##Key Features
1. Sticky Scrolling
The leaderboard in this Android project has been designed to prioritize the user's own rank. When scrolling through the leaderboard, the user's own rank will stick to the top and bottom, ensuring that it remains visible as they navigate through the list of rankings. This provides a better user experience and easy access to their own position on the leaderboard.

2. Mock Data Pagination
To demonstrate the functionality effectively and ensure scalability, the leaderboard displays a minimum of 1000 ranks through pagination. This means that the leaderboard can efficiently handle a large dataset, making it suitable for real-world applications with extensive user participation.

3. ProGuard Integration
ProGuard has been integrated into the application to enhance security. ProGuard is a code obfuscation tool that renames classes, methods, and fields in the compiled code, making it more challenging for reverse engineers to understand the codebase. This improves the protection of sensitive data and intellectual property.
